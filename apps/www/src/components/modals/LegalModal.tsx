              Welcome to the Rhiva. We’re excited to have you join us as we test
              and improve our liquidity yield aggregator on Solana. Before you
              dive in, please read these simple terms so we’re all on the same
              page.

                <p>
                  Rhiva is currently in beta which means things are still
                  experimental. Features may change, break, or even disappear
                  without notice. Joining the beta doesn’t guarantee you’ll
                  always have access to future versions.

                  Rhiva helps you explore liquidity and yield opportunities on
                  Solana, but we are not giving financial advice. All choices
                  you make (adding liquidity, farming, etc.) are 100% your
                  responsibility.

                  Risks You Should Know
                </span>
                <p>
                  DeFi and blockchain come with risks: token volatility, smart
                  contract bugs, or even total loss of funds. Since this is a
                  beta product, expect possible glitches, downtime, or
                  unexpected behavior. You’re using Rhiva at your own risk.

                </span>
                <p>
                  Rhiva’s contracts have been reviewed by third-party security
                  platforms 🔒. This adds an extra layer of protection, but it
                  does not guarantee 100% safety. Always do your own research
                  and only risk what you can afford to lose.
