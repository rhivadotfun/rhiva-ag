                  Rhiva is currently in beta which means things are still
                  experimental. Features may change, break, or even disappear
                  without notice. Joining the beta doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll
                  always have access to future versions.

                  Rhiva helps you explore liquidity and yield opportunities on
                  Solana, but we are not giving financial advice. All choices
                  you make (adding liquidity, farming, etc.) are 100% your

                <p>
                  DeFi and blockchain come with risks: token volatility, smart
                  contract bugs, or even total loss of funds. Since this is a
                  beta product, expect possible glitches, downtime, or
                  unexpected behavior. You‚Äôre using Rhiva at your own risk.

                  Rhiva‚Äôs contracts have been reviewed by third-party security
                  platforms üîí. This adds an extra layer of protection, but it

                  and only risk what you can afford to lose.
