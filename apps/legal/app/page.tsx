            <p>
              Rhiva is currently in beta which means things are still
              experimental. Features may change, break, or even disappear
              without notice. Joining the beta doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll always
              have access to future versions.

            <p>
              Rhiva helps you explore liquidity and yield opportunities on
              Solana, but we are not giving financial advice. All choices you
              make (adding liquidity, farming, etc.) are 100% your

            </p>
            <p>
              DeFi and blockchain come with risks: token volatility, smart
              contract bugs, or even total loss of funds. Since this is a beta
              product, expect possible glitches, downtime, or unexpected
              behavior. You‚Äôre using Rhiva at your own risk.

              4. Security Check (But No Guarantees)
            </p>
            <p>
              Rhiva‚Äôs contracts have been reviewed by third-party security
              platforms üîí. This adds an extra layer of protection, but it does
              not guarantee 100% safety. Always do your own research and only
              risk what you can afford to lose.
